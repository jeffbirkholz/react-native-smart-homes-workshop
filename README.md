# Presentation boilerplate

This boilerplate is for presentations or workshops that want to use [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle) library together with spectacle code slide

I used forked spectacle [repo](https://github.com/vnovick/spectacle-code-slide) do be able to change styles of Header and Notes components. 

## Usage

- Fork the repo
- run `npm install` (it will execute install presentation folder dependencies)
- run `npm run present` to show presentation on port 3000
- run `npm run deploy-presentation` to deploy presentation to surge.sh
